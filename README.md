### Topic

I choose anime as my site topic because my really long time admiration and Anime boasts such vibrancy and diversity in its characters. People in anime have dynamic personalities, they’re whole people (even when they aren’t human); they have dreams and goals, and beyond that, there’s just so much variance in what they are. Ghosts, detectives, ghouls, pirates, demons, high school students, office workers… the list goes on, and there’s no limit to what a character might be, or who they might be.
